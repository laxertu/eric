**Introduction**

Eric is basically a toolkit for building async message management applications, paying special attention to Server Side Events based ones.
Its main components are:

* A core model with a set of abstractions and prefabs that gives support to SSE.
* A persistence layer composed by a set of interfaces and base classes for building concrete layers
